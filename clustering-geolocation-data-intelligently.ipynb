As the value of K increases, there will be fewer elements in the cluster. So average distortion will decrease. The lesser number of elements means closer to the centroid. So, the point where this distortion declines the most is the elbow point.\n\nFirst of all, we compute the sum of squared errors(SSE) for some values of K(example, 2,3,4,6,etc).The SSE is the sum of squared distance between each member of the cluster and its centroid.\n\nIf we plot K value against the SSE,the error decreases as the K Value increases because if the number of cluster increases, they should be smaller. Accordingly the distortion becomes also smaller.\n\nFrom this perspective, the idea of using elbow method is to choose K Value at which SSE decreases abruptly, and this produces an elbow effect as we can see in the following picture.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"url=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vc01j.png\"\nImage(url,width=800, height=800)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T17:12:18.212517Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T17:12:18.212776Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T17:12:18.533717Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T17:12:18.212741Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T17:12:18.53289Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"purple\">\nIn the plot above, we see the number of cluster on the x-axis and within group sum of squares.\n\nWe try to choose a K Value where we won't get much information by increasing the number of classes, which means that we will not significantly within groups sum of squares by increase the number of clusters.\n\nThe number 2 or 3 is the most ideal in this plot because it is the first point the elbow shape happens and avoid to increase the number clusters more.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.3.

DBSCAN","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"purple\">\nBased on a set of points (letâ€™s think in a bidimensional space as exemplified in the figure), DBSCAN groups together points that are close to each other based on a distance measurement (usually Euclidean distance) and a minimum number of points. It also marks as outliers the points that are in low-density regions.\nParameters:\nThe DBSCAN algorithm basically requires 2 parameters:\neps: specifies how close points should be to each other to be considered a part of a cluster. It means that if the distance between two points is lower or equal to this value (eps), these points are considered neighbors.\nminPoints: the minimum number of points to form a dense region. For example, if we set the minPoints parameter as 5, then we need at least 5 points to form a dense region.\n\neps: if the eps value chosen is too small, a large part of the data will not be clustered. It will be considered outliers because donâ€™t satisfy the number of points to create a dense region. On the other hand, if the value that was chosen is too high, clusters will merge and the majority of objects will be in the same cluster. The eps should be chosen based on the distance of the dataset (we can use a k-distance graph to find it), but in general small eps values are preferable.\nminPoints: As a general rule, a minimum minPoints can be derived from a number of dimensions (D) in the data set, as minPoints â‰¥ D + 1. Larger values are usually better for data sets with noise and will form more significant clusters. The minimum value for the minPoints must be 3, but the larger the data set, the larger the minPoints value that should be chosen","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"len(X)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T17:44:12.147061Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T17:44:12.147355Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T17:44:12.153528Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T17:44:12.147326Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T17:44:12.152881Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = DBSCAN(eps=0.01, min_samples=5).fit(X)\nclass_predictions = model.labels_\nclass_predictions","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T17:44:52.703335Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T17:44:52.703674Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T17:44:52.723341Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T17:44:52.703639Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T17:44:52.722009Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"kmeans=KMeans(n_clusters=20,init=\"k-means++\")\npredicted_clusters=kmeans.fit_predict(X)\nsilhouette_score(X,predicted_clusters)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5.Hierarchical Clustering","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"purple\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from scipy.cluster import hierarchy \nhier=hierarchy.dendrogram(hierarchy.linkage(X, method=\"ward\"))\nplt.title(\"Dendogram of Hierarchical Clustering\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Observation Points\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Euclidean Distance\")\nplt.show() ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T17:32:10.107586Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T17:32:10.107951Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T17:32:25.584872Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T17:32:10.107894Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T17:32:25.584048Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering\nac=AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=20, affinity=\"euclidean\",linkage=\"ward\")\nagglomerative_clusters= ac.fit_predict(X)\nagglomerative_clusters","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T17:46:51.258374Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T17:46:51.258708Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T17:46:51.289544Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T17:46:51.258676Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T17:46:51.288736Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"silhouette_score(X,agglomerative_clusters)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T17:47:31.785986Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T17:47:31.786366Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T17:47:31.810903Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T17:47:31.786328Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T17:47:31.810008Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df3= pd.DataFrame(agglomerative_clusters, columns=[\"Agglomerative Clusters\"])\nnew_df=pd.concat([new_df,df3],axis=1)\nnew_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T17:49:41.138265Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T17:49:41.139142Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T17:49:41.158579Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T17:49:41.139096Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T17:49:41.157444Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(18, 10), sharey=True)\nfig.suptitle('Distribution of Cluster')\n\n# KMeans Clustering\nsns.scatterplot(ax=axes[0], x=new_df[\"LAT\"], y=new_df[\"LON\"],hue=new_df[\"KMeans Clusters\"],palette=\"viridis\")\naxes[0].set_title(\"According to KMeans Clusters\")\n#Agglomerative Clustering\nsns.scatterplot(ax=axes[1], x=new_df[\"LAT\"], y=new_df[\"LON\"],hue=new_df[\"Agglomerative Clusters\"],palette=\"viridis\")\naxes[0].set_title(\"According to Agglomerative Clusters\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-16T17:50:32.577971Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-16T17:50:32.578327Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-16T17:50:33.765843Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-16T17:50:32.578291Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-16T17:50:33.764992Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
